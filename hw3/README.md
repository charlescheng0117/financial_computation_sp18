Basic Requirement
---
- Rainbow Option: Max( Max(S1, S2, ..., Sn) - K, 0 )
- Cholesky Decomposition Method: Algorithm is on FE_Ch05, Page 5-4


Bonus 1
---
- Antithetic variance approach: satisfying the zero mean and the symmetric feature of the standard normal distribution. FE_Ch05, Page 5-8, (i)
- Moment matching: matching the first two memonts of the standard normal distribution. FE_Ch05, Page 5-8, (ii)
    - Draw random samples z1, z2, ..., zn first. Suppose mean = m, s.d. = s.
    - Define: 
        - yi = (zi - m) / s => get y1, y2, ..., yn
        - mean = 0, s.d. = 1 now
